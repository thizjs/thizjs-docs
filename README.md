# Philosophy

## Why THIZ.js?

Stop copying boilerplate. Stop configuring routers. Start building.

Backend development shouldn't require you to wire up the same infrastructure over and over. THIZ.js exists to eliminate the repetitive parts so you can focus on what actually matters—your application logic.

## Core Beliefs

### Conventions Over Configuration

Patterns that make sense beat endless config files. Your folder structure should define your routes. Your file names should define your HTTP methods. Middleware placement should be obvious from its location.

No magic, just sensible defaults.

### Developer Experience First

Fast feedback loops matter. Hot reload should be instant. Route changes should reflect immediately. Error messages should tell you exactly what's wrong and how to fix it.

Development should feel smooth, not frustrating.

### Progressive Enhancement

Start simple, add complexity only when needed. 

A basic API should require zero configuration. When you need advanced features—multiple route directories, custom middleware chains, TypeScript—they should be available without fighting the framework.

### No Magic

Clear, predictable behavior you can understand. File-based routing isn't magic—it's convention. Middleware application follows simple rules. When something breaks, you know exactly where to look.

Transparency over cleverness.

## What This Means

**You shouldn't need to:**
- Import and mount routers manually
- Register every single route
- Repeat the same middleware setup everywhere
- Configure a bundler for backend code
- Choose between DX and production-readiness

**You should be able to:**
- Create a file and have a route
- Drop a middleware and have it work
- Change code and see results instantly
- Understand how everything fits together
- Ship to production with confidence

## The Goal

Make backend development less repetitive and more joyful.

You have ideas to build. THIZ.js handles the boring parts so you can focus on the interesting ones.
